 game_concept_CTFA_form_of_address_desc:0 "Be it \"Duke\", \"High Queen\", \"Kaiser\" or some other term, $game_concept_CTFA_form_of_address$ is the way a [ruler|E] is addressed or referred to based on the most significant [title|E] they hold, usually their [primary_title|E].\n\nA player can customize $game_concept_CTFA_form_of_address$ for their own or their vassal's [primary_title|E], as long as it's at least of a [duchy|E] [title_tier|E].\nCustom $game_concept_CTFA_form_of_address$ is tied to the [primary_title|E] it was set for and will be inherited along with it. Should this title cease to be primary, its [holder|E] will stop using the corresponding custom $game_concept_CTFA_form_of_address$ and will switch to the appropriate $game_concept_CTFA_foa$ for their new primary title."
